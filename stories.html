    <h2>The Tortoise and the Birds</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, all the birds of the sky decided to attend a grand feast in heaven. The tortoise, known for his cleverness, wanted to go too. He borrowed feathers from each bird, created wings, and flew with them. When they arrived, the tortoise tricked everyone and ate most of the food. The birds were angry and took back their feathers, leaving him to fall from the sky.</p>
    <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Pride and greed always lead to downfall. Be honest and content with what you have.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="story">
    <h2>The Lion and the Clever Hare</h2>
    <p>There was a lion that terrorized all the animals in the forest. Every day, one animal was sent to him as a sacrifice. When it was the hare‚Äôs turn, he came up with a plan. He told the lion another lion had challenged his power. The lion followed the hare to a deep well and, seeing his reflection, roared in anger and jumped in ‚Äî never to return.</p>
    <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Intelligence is more powerful than brute strength. Wisdom can defeat might.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="story">
    <h2>The Farmer and His Three Sons</h2>
    <p>A wise old farmer had three sons who constantly fought. To teach them unity, he gave them a bundle of sticks and asked them to break it. None could. Then he untied the bundle, and they easily broke the sticks one by one. The father said, ‚ÄúIf you stand united, no one can break you.‚Äù</p>
    <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Unity is strength. When we stand together, we can overcome any challenge.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="story">
    <h2>The Talking Drum</h2>
    <p>In an old African village, there was a magical drum that spoke only to kind hearts. Greedy people would hear nothing but silence. When a humble child played it, the drum sang songs of joy and brought blessings to the whole village.</p>
    <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Kindness opens doors that greed cannot. A pure heart brings lasting joy.</p>
